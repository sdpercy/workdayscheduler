1. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. When you scroll down there are time blocks for standard business hours
3. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past(grey), present(red), or future(green)
4. Enter a description for what is scheduled for that time block by WHEN clicking into a time block and enter an event.
5. To save the entry click the save button for that time block.  The text will be saved to localstorage
6. WHEN you refresh the page the saved events persist.
